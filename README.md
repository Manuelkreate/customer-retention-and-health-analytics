# Fund-ify Growth Strategy Dashboard

### Analytical Report (Power BI)

## I. Executive Summary — The Path to Sustainable Growth
This dashboard was built to move **Fund-ify** beyond simple volume tracking and toward a measurable, actionable growth strategy focused on customer retention and service health.

**Core Principles**
1. **Retention is the New Acquisition:** Keeping customers drastically lowers the cost of growth.  
2. **Value over Volume:** Focus on customers who generate high average value.  
3. **Friction = Churn:** Quantify service issues as a leading indicator of customer loss.

The analysis provides management with specific, localized actions to increase loyalty and profitability.

## II. Growth & Monetization Summary

**Goal:** Deliver an immediate pulse on scale and revenue efficiency.

### A. Performance Snapshot (Top KPIs)
Four KPI cards track:
- **New Customers**
- **Retention Rate**
- **Total Transaction Value (TTV)**
- **Average Customer Value (ACV)**  

Each includes **MoM change** indicators to show rising or falling momentum.

### B. Service Portfolio Health (Growth Quadrant)
A scatter plot classifies products by **TTV (Volume)** and **ACV (Value):**

| Quadrant | Meaning | Mandate |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Top Right (Ideal)** | High revenue & high value | Nurture and protect these products |
| **Bottom Right (Habit Builders)** | High volume, low value | Cross-sell higher-value products |
| **Bottom Left (Underperformers)** | Low volume, low value | Re-evaluate or simplify offerings |

### C. Revenue Contribution & Acquisition

| Visual | Insight & Action |
|---------|------------------|
| **Revenue Concentration (Column Chart)** | Shows TTV by Service Type. Direct investment toward top-performing products. |
| **Geographic Acquisition (Map)** | Shows New Customers by Region. Optimize acquisition spend in high-growth regions. |

## III. Retention & Health Deep Dive

**Goal:** Diagnose loyalty and detect quantifiable churn risks.

### A. Customer Stickiness & Risk Analysis
**Visual:** Retention Rate by Usage Bucket (Line Chart)  
**Action:** Identify which user groups are most loyal. If light users drop early, prioritize activation campaigns in their first 3 months.

### B. Segmenting the Churn Risk

| Visual | Insight & Action |
|---------|------------------|
| **High-Risk Profile (Bar Chart)** | Ranks age groups by friction rate. Helps product teams target UX or stability fixes for the most frustrated demographic. |
| **Friction Across Services (Donut Chart)** | Shows friction rate by service type. Highlights which products (e.g., Lending) cause the most user friction and require immediate attention. |

---

## IV. Segmentation & Action

**Goal:** Translate strategic insights into localized, actionable team priorities.

### A. Prioritization of Profit and Value

| Visual | Focus | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Monetization Sweet Spots (Matrix)** | Value Localization | Shows ACV by Region × Service Type. Sales teams should promote the highest-value service per region. |
| **Revenue Concentration (Donut)** | Financial Risk | Shows TTV share by Region. If one region >40% of revenue, shift budget to diversify exposure. |

### B. Operations and Support Mandate

| Visual | Focus | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Friction Action Matrix (Matrix)** | Operational Fix Priority | Shows Friction Rate by Service Type × Region. The darkest (highest-friction) cells mark the most critical service failures needing immediate resolution. |
